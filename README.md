# Autonomous-Zea-Mays-Seeding-and-Monitoring-Agribot-using-IoT
The project is used for seeding corn seeds and monitoring the corn field after the seeding till harvesting time.

The Git consists of codes used in the different modules. It consists of Project Proposal also.

The software used is Ardunio IDE. All the codes are in the format of .ino 
The microcontroller used here is Arduino Uno for GSM and Motor Control Module.
The Seeding Robot is controlled by Arduino Mega 2560.
